					<strong>Water Proofing</strong>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<p>
							An effective and durable waterproofing system is absolutely critical to ensure the long-term durability of the structure and to keep maintenance costs low
							by avoiding frequent repair. In sensitive buildings like Hotels, Hospitals, Power plants, Malls , Multiplexes, Corporate offices and premium residences a
							proper waterproofing system helps preserve the costly finishes provided within the building and also helps in maintaining the optimum usability of all
							areas which is critical from revenue generation point of view. In coastal areas, prone to corrosion damage, waterproofing systems help to keep out water
							and pollutants thereby protecting structural elements and embedded steel reinforcement. A good waterproofing system also needs to be protected from
							mechanical damage during the service life of the building to ensure that it keeps performing at optimum level for a very long period of time, even beyond
							the warranty period to provide maximum value for money to the end users.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<p>
							Deciding on the right waterproofing system for a particular building and for a specific location within the building is also very essential. For e.g. a
							waterproofing system or product designed for a roof may not perform in a basement application and vice versa. Even geographical location, usage conditions,
							climatic conditions, rainfall patterns, performance requirements and cost economics all play a vital role in deciding the type of waterproofing to be
							chosen. For e.g. the waterproofing for a roof garden would differ from the waterproofing for a sloping roof. A single level basement in a high watertable
							zone would need a higher performing system as compared to a three level deep basement albeit in a low watertable area and so on.

How Many Different Types Of Waterproofing?
</h3>

<div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2532762359079935460" itemprop="description articleBody">
<b>How many different types of waterproofing are there in the market and which one do I choose to use for my usage?</b> <br>
<br>
This is the most frequently ask questions when choosing types of waterproofing system to use.&nbsp; Often when comes to the design stage, most of the architect or consultant will ponder the question.<br>
<br>
There are few types of the most commonly use system of <i>waterproofing</i> in the construction industry.&nbsp; They are :<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cementitious waterproofing<br>
<br>
    	<div class="cat-list-item right inverse">	<a href="/#"><img  class="img-responsive" src="img/CivilWork/CementitiousWaterproofing.jpg" alt="Travertine Tile"></a></div>
    <br />
Cementitious waterproofing is often used in the internal wet areas such as toilets.&nbsp; Most of the time the type of cementitious waterproofing is semi-flexible, some even toward rigid type.&nbsp; It is still good to use because internal toilets are not exposed to sunlight and weathering and so it do not go through the contraction and expansion process continuously.<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid waterproofing membrane<br>
<br>
    	<div class="cat-list-item right inverse">	<a href="/#"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/CivilWork/LiquidWaterproofing.jpg" alt="Travertine Tile"></a></div>
    <br />
Liquid membrane is a thin coating which consists of usually a primer coat and two coats of top coats. It offer more flexibility than the cementitious types of waterproofing.&nbsp; The elongation properties of the coating can reach as high as 280%.&nbsp; But the durability of the waterproofing coating also depend on what type of polymer the manufacturer use for the making of the liquid waterproofing.<br>
<br>
3. &nbsp; Bituminuos coating<br>

    	<div class="cat-list-item right inverse">	<a href="/#"><img  class="img-responsive" src="img/CivilWork/BituminuosCoating.jpg" alt="Travertine Tile"></a></div>
    <br />
Bituminuos waterproofing coating is made of bitumen based materials and it is not suitable for expose to sunlight.&nbsp; It become very brittle and fragile when long exposure to the sunlight unless it is modified with more flexible material such as polyurethane or arcylic based polymers.&nbsp; The flexibility of the finished products always depend on the solid content of the polymer added to the bitumen.<br>
<br>
4. &nbsp;&nbsp; Bituminuous membrane<br>
<br>
    	<div class="cat-list-item right inverse">	<a href="/#"><img  class="img-responsive" src="img/CivilWork/BituminuousMembrane.jpg" alt="Travertine Tile"></a></div>
    <br />
Bituminuous waterproofing membrane have torch on membrane and self adhesive membrane.&nbsp; Torch on membrane is the more preferred one use because of its shelf life and ease of use during application. <br>
<br>
The self adhesive type must be use fast as the bonding properties of the membrane is reducing through time.&nbsp; Very often applicators find the self adhesion membrane already lose its bonding properties when they want to apply.&nbsp; therefore, they have to use one additional primer to prevent the debonding problem in the near future.<br>
<br>
Torch on membrane have exposed and covered types.&nbsp; Exposed membrane often has mineral granular aggregate to withstand the wear and tear of the weathering and the other types of membrane, contractor need to apply one protective screed to provent the puncture of the membrane.<br>
<br>
But one has to be very careful when applying the protective screed which is often cement mortar.&nbsp; The cement ratio has to be high and the mixing has to be thorough through out the process.&nbsp; There are premixed type of cement mortar in the market available for use for better quality and consistency.&nbsp; Site mix usually will compensate the quality of the finish work but the cost is always cheaper compared to premixed mortar.<br>
<br>
5.&nbsp; Polyurethane liquid membrane<br>
<br>
    	<div class="cat-list-item right inverse">	<a href="/#"><img  class="img-responsive" src="img/CivilWork/PolyurethaneLiquidMembrane.jpg" alt="Travertine Tile"></a></div>
    <br />
Polyurethane is also use for the flat roof area and exposed to weathering but it is expensive. It can offer higher flexibility.&nbsp; Polyurethane is very sensitive to moisture content present, therefore before application, one has to be very careful evaluating the moisture content of the concrete slab.&nbsp; Otherwise peeling or debonding easily observed after some time.

    <br>
      <br>
6.&nbsp; Crystalline Waterproofing<br>
<br/><p>
    	<div class="cat-list-item right inverse">	<a href="/#"><img  class="img-responsive" src="img/CivilWork/CrystallineWaterproofing.jpg" alt="Travertine Tile"></a></div>
    <br />
crystalline waterproofing technology has been around for more than 3 decades, it is still considered "state-of-the-art" and has only recently been embraced by the construction industry as a superior replacement for conventional membranes. Crystalline waterproofing systems rely on a technology that turns porous concrete in to an impermeable barrier. The result is a structure with reduced cracking, self-sealing and waterproofing abilities which provides a powerful defense against water damage and corrosion of reinforcing steel. </p>
<p>
Unlike sheet membranes, which rely on an additional hurdle to shield the concrete from moisture, crystalline waterproofing system actually transforms the concrete into a water-resistant barrier. It becomes an integral part of the concrete matrix when applied to existing concrete or added to the mix at time of batching. </p>
    <p>
The crystalline waterproofing chemistry can be introduced into new concrete as an admixture, a dry-shake product, or a surface-applied coating. For older (i.e., cured) concrete, surface-applied coatings are used. The substrate must be wet for the chemicals to move through the concrete and for the chemical reaction to occur. With a surface coating application, the high concentration of chemicals at the surface naturally tends to spread out or diffuse into the water saturated substrate. Keeping the concrete moist maintains a conduit for the crystalline chemicals to travel. 
    </p><p>
Recently built structures and heritage buildings need water protection too! Whether we are waterproofing a new structure or repairing leaks, concrete waterproofing treatments allow us to turn existing concrete into a waterproof barrier reliably and cost-effectively </p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
    <h6><b>Penetron Waterproofing:</b> </h6>
   	<div class="cat-list-item right inverse">	<a href="/#"><img  class="img-responsive" src="img/CivilWork/PenetronWaterproofing.jpg" alt="Travertine Tile"></a></div>
    <br />
    PENETRONâ€™s crystalline technology enhances the durability, strength, overall performance and lifespan of concrete. Our cementitious capillary waterproofing products include crystalline waterproofing, waterstops and liquid sealers. They combine high quality cements, quartz, (special grade) sand and proprietary active ingredients to provide the most effective system to permanently reduce the permeability of concrete.
